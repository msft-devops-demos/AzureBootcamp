# Lab 4 - REST and Microservices

[Back to Main Menu](../../../README.md)

In this lab, you will create some skeletons of microservices and learn how Azure Function Proxies can help present a unified API surface, and help accelerate and unblock development.

Now that you're used to creating Function Apps and working in the Azure Portal, there are fewer hints in this lab. Your instructor can help, or take a look at the Azure Functions documentation.
